Welcome to my project's repository 😁

Here, you'll find a major part of my projects 🎁 _(the public ones)_

## Groups

They'll be grouped by category, such as:

  - 🏫 **academic/study**: When the purpose is to learn a new
    concept/technology or is designed to an academic showing/exam

  - 📊 **commercial**: Some program/project to help a
    community/commercial group (probably open source)

  - 🤝 **contributions**: Some program/project that I've contribute to

  - 🎉 **personal**: When the purpose is to build something for my self usage
    (or no-sense thinks that I like to do)

> [!NOTE]
> 
> All groups can be found in this repository _(at projects path)_
>
> Each filename mean a group category and have it own projects
> content such as:
>   - name
>   - description
>   - link url
>
> ---
>
> The same project can appear in different groups (for example, a
> project I'm working on is in the `personal` group, but it might
> also be in the `contributions` group if I'm a co-owner).
