Welcome to my project's repository 😁

Here, you'll find a major part of my projects 🎁 _(the public ones)_

## Groups

They'll be grouped by category, such as:

  - 🏫 [academic/study](https://github.com/nasccped/nascc.projects/blob/main/projects/academic-study.md):
    When the purpose is to learn a new concept/technology or is
    designed to an academic showing/exam

  - 📊 [commercial](https://github.com/nasccped/nascc.projects/blob/main/projects/commercial.md):
    Some program/project to help a community/commercial group
    (probably open source)

  - 🤝 [contributions](https://github.com/nasccped/nascc.projects/blob/main/projects/contributions.md):
    Some program/project that I've contribute too

  - 🎉 [personal](https://github.com/nasccped/nascc.projects/blob/main/projects/personal.md):
    When the purpose is to build something for my self usage
    (or no-sense thinks that I like to do)

> [!NOTE]
>
> The same project can appear in different groups (for example, a
> project I'm working on is in the `personal` group, but it might
> also be in the `contributions` group if I'm a co-owner).
