Welcome to my project's repository 😁

Here, you'll find a major part of my projects 🎁 _(the public ones)_

## Groups

They'll be grouped by category, such as:
  - **academic/study** 🏫

    When the purpose is to learn a new concept/technology or is
    designed to an academic showing/exam

  - **personal** 🎉

    When the purpose is to build something for my self usage
    (or no-sense thinks that I like to do)

  - **commercial** 🤝

    Some program/project to help a community/commercial group
    (probably open source)
